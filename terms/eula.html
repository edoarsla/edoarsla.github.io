                        The Software automatically communicates with ConfigHub servers for three purposes:
                        (1) to check for a new version of the Software;
                        (2) sending error reports; and
                        (3) sending anonymized usage data so we may improve the Software. If you would like to learn more about
                        the specific information we send, please visit
                        <a href="https://docs.confighub.com" class="uri">https://docs.confighub.com</a>.

                        You may opt out of sending the anonymized usage data, but if you do not want the Software to
                        automatically check for new version releases or send error reports, you must uninstall the Software.

                            The Software communicates with ConfigHub (and sends information described at the URL above) to
                            determine whether there are any patches, bug fixes, updates, upgrades or other modifications to
                            improve the Software. This feature may not be disabled. If you do not want to receive automatic
                            update notification, you must uninstall the Software.

                            In order to help us improve the Software, when the Software encounters certain errors, it will
                            automatically send some information to ConfigHub about the error (as described at the URL above).
                            This feature may not be disabled. If you do not want to send error reports to ConfigHub,
                            you must uninstall the Software.

                            ConfigHub collects anonymized data about your usage of the Software to help us make it more awesome.
                            Approximately once a day the Software sends such data (as described in more detail at the URL above)
                            to ConfigHub's servers. If you do not want to send anonymized usage data to ConfigHub, you may opt
                            out by changing your settings as described in ConfigHub's documentation.
