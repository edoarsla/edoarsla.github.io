                    <p>
                        ConfigHub is an Application Control Platform (ACP).
                        It is capable of centralizing configuration for the entire development stack,
                        via private, secure, versioned configuration repositories.
                        In contrast to infrastructure-centric tools (i.e. Chef, Puppet, Salt, or DIY)
                        ConfigHub is unique because our focus is on managing large and diverse configuration sets for all
                        code developed and maintained by the enterprise.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The unique approach of managing configuration via context definitions,
                        allows abstraction of each application segment in a way that completely
                        eliminates all configuration duplication and thus enables simple,
                        safe and fast configuration management.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        ConfigHub platform is free, it is
                        <a ui-sref="download">downloaded</a> and installed locally.

        <div class="container">

                    <h2>What is context?</h2>

                    <p>
                        At the heart of ConfigHub is context.  It eliminates configuration duplication, greatly
                        simplifies configuration in large systems, and lets
                        you define your application space in a way not limited by any pre-determined conditions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The traditional configuration property is defined as a key-value pair:
                        <pre>key: value</pre>

                        The limitation of this definition is that it does nothing to
                        describe who should know about this property, and therefore it will get duplicated for each
                        consumer (application/instance).
                    </p>


                    <h4>Context properties and files</h4>
                    <p>
                        To overcome this limitation, we expanded the definition of the property to add context to the value.
                        A context property looks like this:
                        <pre>key: { context: value }</pre>

                        Now, context describes a subset of applications that should know about this property.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        Furthermore, a key may have multiple values because the context for each value has to be unique
                        within the key.  And the same logic applies to files.  Currently a file
                        name has to be unique for a specific path.  However, with addition of context,
                        multiple files with the same name can exist in the same path.
                    </p>

key: {

                    <h4>Repository context</h4>
                    <p>
                        A repository, when created, defines a context that will be used by context properties and files.
                        Repository context is defined to best describe your application space.  It may be as simple as
                        <pre>Environment > Application</pre> or as "wide scoped" as you need it to be
                        - i.e. <pre>Company > System > Platform > Environment > Application > Instance</pre>
                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        Applications receive configuration via PULL request from ConfigHub platform just by specifying
                        their running context.  Application's context has to be fully-specified, meaning, each element
                        of the context has to be specified.  With fully specified context, only a single, most specific
                        context property value and context file is returned.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        ConfigHub platform uses RESTful Json API for both configuration PUSH and PULL.
                        There are also several language specific APIs available on the
                        <a ui-sref="download">download</a> page.

                            <p>
                                In basic setup, ConfigHub is running either as a Docker container or
                                on metal/cloud installation.  It requires connection to two databases.
                                The "Main" database is used to store all repository and user data, and it is recommended
                                for this database to have a replica.  The second database is an archive of all
                                API request, and replication is optional (depending on how relevant this information is to you.)
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In this setup, applications will use either a language specific API, or a RESTful JSON
                                API to pull configuration directly from the ConfigHub app server.

                                full operational state is recovered.

                                    locally from the agent, which will then fetch configuration from ConfigHub service and
                                    store it locally as last-know-configuration for each requested context.
